Summary: Using Python to perform Clustering in an unsupervised manner, finding groups of similar NBA players based on their per-minute statistics for the 2017/2018 regular season. K-means was used with smart initialization, and the value of k chosen based on an analysis of the improved total cost vs the penalty to interpretability.
