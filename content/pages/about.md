Title: About Me
Slug: about

Being an Engineer can mean different things to different people. To me, it means that I have a passion for understanding how things work.
This can be anything from mechanical systems, natural phenomena to software.

This website is a place for me to show my personal work in data science, deriving insight from data using a variety of statistical tools and models.

I have completed the following data science/machine learning courses from Coursera:
[Machine Learning - University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
[Deep Learning - deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

My interests outside of work include Basketball, Volleyball, Gaming (various platforms) and Travelling.

To contact me please feel free to drop an e-mail: phil_bingham45@hotmail.com.

I am happy to discuss anything from how I built this website to details of my blog posts to potential job opportunities!
